# Watches
This proejct is watch managment system where you can find different brands of watches. User can also do sign up from this page.

I have made this project using bootstrap4 ,css, javascript and phop for backend.
I have deployed my website task to 000webhost which is a free website hosting site.
I had also attached pdf which was perfectly rendered on localhost but when I uploaded it on 000webhost it is being not showed properly.
 Below are the credentials of the database that i have used.
 
db name: id14246558_watchlanddb
user: id14246558_root
passowrd: Watchland@123

for website:
username: watchland
pass: watchland

I have also uploaded the source code to giithub for ref. but to work it functionally the 000webhost link will work.
